SmallWorld Score Tracker
Kara James

This is a small python program that enables the user to keep track of all players' scores while playing the board game SmallWorld or SmallWorld Underground.

Run the program with $python SmallworldScore.py

Initialized:
- Creates player classes for each
- Adds scores to that class

In Progress:
- Subtracting scores (due to buying into races)

Future Plans:
- Adding compatibility for all expansions
