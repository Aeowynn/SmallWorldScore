#SmallWorld Score Tracker

Kara James



This is a small python program that enables the user to keep track of all players' scores while playing the board game SmallWorld or SmallWorld Underground.

##Run the program with $python SmallworldScore.py

###Initialized:
- Creates player classes for each
- Adds scores to that class
- Main screen, Spent Screen

###In Progress:
- Subtracting scores (due to buying into races)
- Bugfixing player class

###Future Plans:
- Adding compatibility for all expansions
- Possibly adding a GUI
